			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>
				You can copy a file from your local system to your My Workspace or site Resources using the Add button 
				in the Resources tool. If you want to copy several files or an entire folder all at once, software called WebDAV 
				can be used to drag files or folders from your local computer to or from the site Resources folders.
			</p>
			<p>
				Several setup steps are required to make your computer treat the site Resources folder 
				as another folder on your computer. Once you have set up a particular course or project resource folder using 
				WebDAV, you can drag files and folders to the course or project Resource area from your local computer and vice versa. 
				Please note that these connections are specific to the computer you are using, so if you change computers you will 
				have to set up the connection again.
			</p>

			<h4>Setting up WebDAV for Windows XP</h4>
			<p>
				Note: There must be at least one object (file, folder etc.) in the course or project resource area before you begin the 
				setup procedure. This procedure needs to be done once for each site before you can use WebDAV to transfer 
				files to and from any one site.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Double-click on the My Network Places icon on your PC desktop to open the Network Places folder</li>
				<li>Double-click on the Add Network Place icon</li>
				<li>Click Next</li>
		
				<li>Click on the bottom choice: &quot;Choose another network location&quot;</li>
				<li>Click Next</li>
				<li>
					In the &quot;Internet or network address&quot; field, type the URL for this site shown above.<br />
					<img src="netwkplace.jpg" width="423" height="345" style="clear:both;display:block;margin:1em 0 " alt="" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Click Next<br />
					Note: If you receive an alert such as &quot;The folder you've entered does not appear to be valid,&quot; 
					it could be there are no resources yet in your site. Go to the site and add a file to initialize the Resources 
					folder, then return to Step 1.
				</li>
				<li>When asked for your username and password, enter your Sakai username and your password</li>
				<li>
					Enter a name for the course or project resources you are adding. This name is used on your computer when 
					referencing the course or project resource folder.
					<img src="name.jpg" width="423" height="345" alt="" style="clear:both;display:block;margin:1em 0" />
				</li>
				<li>Click &quot;Finish&quot; to complete the set up.</li>
				<li>
					When the setup is complete, the course or project resources folder will appear in your My Network Places as a folder. 
					It will also show up under My Network Places in Windows Explorer, where it will act just like any other folder 
					in Windows Explorer.
				</li>
				<li>You can now drag files and folders to and from your computer and the site Resources folder.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Setting up WebDAV for Windows Vista</h4>
			<p>
				Note 1: There must be at least one object (file, folder etc.) in the course or project resource area before you begin the 
				setup procedure. This procedure needs to be done once for each site before you can use WebDAV to transfer 
				files to and from any one site.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note 2: There are a number of known issues with support for WebDAV in Windows Vista. You may therefore experience difficulties using WebDAV as described below.
			</p>

			<ol>
			<li>From the desktop, click Computer.</li>
			
			<li>Click Map Network Drive.</li>
			
			<li>On the Map Network Drive screen, click "Connect to a Web site
			that you can use to store your documents and pictures", and then
			click Next.</li>
			
			<li>Click "Choose a custom network location", and then click
			Next.</li>

			<li>In the "Internet or network address" field, type the URL for this site shown above, and then click
			Next.</li>

			<li>When prompted, enter your Sakai username and password.</li>

			<li>You can now drag files and folders to and from your computer and the site Resources folder.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Setting up WebDAV for Mac (OS 10.0 - 10.3)</h4>
			<p>
				Note 1: These instructions include the download of a program named Goliath. Users have reported errors using this 
				program with Sakai, including the inability to create new folders or download folders to their local computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note 2: There must be at least one object (file, folder etc.) in the course or project resource area before you begin 
				the setup procedure. This procedure needs to be done once for each site before you can use WebDAV to 
				transfer files to and from any one site.
			</p>
		
			<ol>
				<li>
					Download the Goliath WebDav client at:<br />
					<a href="http://www.webdav.org/goliath/#download" target="_blank">
						<code>http://www.webdav.org/goliath/#download</code>
					</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Decompress the file and double-click on the .dmg file. (Depending on your version and configuration of Stuffit, 
					the disk image may automatically mount.)
				</li>
				<li>
					A disk image named "Goliath 1.0" should now be available. Simply drag and drop the Goliath folder contained 
					within in the disk image to your hard disk.
					<img src="goliath.jpg" width="241" height="311" alt="" style="clear:both;display:block;margin:1em 0" />
				</li>
				  
				<li>Open the Goliath application.  It will probably be in your Applications folder.</li>
				<li>In the WebDav Connection dialog box, type in the path as shown above.</li>
				<li>Type in your username and password.</li>
				<li>Click the Advanced settings tab and check the box next to "Disable Encoding of Macintosh Recourse."</li>
				<li>Click "OK"</li>
				<li>
					You will now see a window on your Mac screen that represents the resources that are in your site. You can now 
					drag and drop files into this window or use the "Web" menu to upload and download files.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Setting up WebDAV for Mac (OS 10.4)</h4>
			<p>
				Note: There must be at least one object (file, folder etc.) in the course or project resource area before you begin 
				the setup procedure. This procedure needs to be done once for each site before you can use WebDAV to transfer 
				files to and from any one site.
			</p>
			<ol>
		
				<li>From the Finder, select "Go" from the menu bar and then select "Connect to Server..."</li>
				<li>In the resulting dialog box, type in the path as shown above.</li>
				<li>Press the "+" button to save this path for future use.</li>
				<li>Click "Connect"</li>
		
				<li>Type in your username and password and click "OK"</li>
				<li>
					You will now see a window on your Macintosh screen that represents the resources in your site. 
					You can now drag and drop files into this window and delete files by dragging them to the Trash.
