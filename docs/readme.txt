A good start for developers interested in working with Sakai is the wiki
space named "Programmer's Cafe," where many tutorials and tips have
been collected by community developers.

Technical documentation and white papers can be found in the architecture/
directory.

COMMUNITY

Most Sakai collaboration happens in one (or both) of two arenas: on list and in our Confluence wiki already linked to here a
number of times (bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence).

To join a Sakai mailing list point your browser to:

http://collab.sakaiproject.org/mailman/listinfo/[list name]

example: http://collab.sakaiproject.org/mailman/listinfo/sakai-dev

You will be asked to fill out a short form (username, password) and you can select whether or not to receive each list post individually (default) or batched in a daily digest. Once you have submitted your request you will be sent a confirmation email with a short set of instructions for confirming your subscription request.
Using a list

To post a message to all the list members, send email to

[list name]@collab.sakaiproject.org

example: sakai-dev@collab.sakaiproject.org
Viewing the list archives

You can review previous posts to the lists by visiting

http://collab.sakaiproject.org/pipermail/[list name]

example: http://collab.sakaiproject.org/pipermail/sakai-dev
Unsubscribing from a list

Simply sending an "unsubscribe" to the LIST address will not unsubscribe you from sakai-dev. To do so, you have two options:

1. Send an e-mail message with the subject of "unsubscribe" to:

      [list name]-request@collab.sakaiproject.org

      You will get a return message asking you to confirm your request.
      
2. Or, point your browser to:

      http://collab.sakaiproject.org/mailman/options/[list name]

      Enter the e-mail address that is subscribed to the list in the box and then click on the "Unsubscribe" button in the middle of the page. You will get a return message asking you to confirm your request.

3. Go to

      http://collab.sakaiproject.org/mailman/listinfo/[list name]

      At the bottom of the page input your email address and click the "Unsubscribe or edit options" and modify your account settings.
