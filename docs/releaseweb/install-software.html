<a name="install-software"></a>6. Getting Started with the Software</h2></div></div></div>

        <p>You should at this point have a working Sakai installation. Now it's time to get
            started with adding users, creating work sites, and otherwise playing around with the
            tools. We won't try to present a full user's guide here, but we can offer some pointers
            to get you oriented and on your way, and link you to more exhaustive sources of
            information elsewhere.</p>
        <div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="install-software-gateway"></a>6.1. The Gateway Page</h3></div></div></div>

            <p>When Tomcat has come up successfully, you should be able to direct your browser to
                its gateway page at <a href="http://localhost:8080/portal" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/portal</a> (or replace 'localhost' with the name of
                the server where it's installed). From the gateway page you can create new accounts
                or browse for public site content. You could start by creating a new account, but
                that can also be done as an admin, and since the admin functions are needed to allow
                this account the right permissions, it's just as well to start by logging in as the
                admin user. Sakai's out-of-the-box admin account is simply named 'admin' (with
                password also 'admin'), so use those credentials to log in.</p>
        </div>

<a name="id2334098"></a>6.2. My Workspace</h3></div></div></div>

            <p>Every user on the system - including the admin - has a private site called
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>My Workspace</em></span>. It's the landing point upon logging in, and
                it's the first site tab visible at the upper left. Running vertically along the
                left-hand side of the screen are links to the various different tool pages within a
                given site, and the admin's <span class="emphasis"><em>My Workspace</em></span> has a different set of
                such options here than most (each different type of account can be configured to
                have a different set of tools in its <span class="emphasis"><em>My Workspace</em></span> by altering a
                template - see below).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id2334134"></a>6.3. Other Sites</h3></div></div></div>

            <p>Each new (accessible) site becomes visible as a tab along the top, to the right of
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>My Workspace</em></span>. For most users, they initially only have
                access to one site - their <span class="emphasis"><em>My Workspace</em></span>. The admin user is a
                little different, in that it has access to two.</p>
            <p>The second admin site (which you can enter by clicking on its tab) is entitled
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>Administration Workspace</em></span> which, strangely enough, looks
                exactly the same as the admin <span class="emphasis"><em>My Workspace</em></span>. It is.</p>
            <p>Why the redundancy? Because you'll likely want to make these admin tools available
                to a particular user who doesn't have access to the admin's <span class="emphasis"><em>My
                Workspace</em></span> (no one has access to other people's <span class="emphasis"><em>My
                Workspace</em></span> on the system). To allow anyone access to the admin tools, you
                need only add them to the list of users of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Administration
                Workspace</em></span>, and then promote them in the site to the "admin" role.</p>
        </div>

<a name="id2334201"></a>6.4.1. Creating Users</h4></div></div></div>

                <p>The first thing you may want to do is to change the admin password to
                    something secure, and to start creating a few sample users on your system. You
                    can do both of those tasks through the <span class="emphasis"><em>Users</em></span> tool on the
                    left. To change the admin user's password, simply click on the 'admin' username
                    in the list of users, and edit the fields on the subsequent page. To create
                    users, click on the <span class="emphasis"><em>New User</em></span> action link at the top of the
                    tool page.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sect3" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="id2334233"></a>6.4.2. Creating Sites</h4></div></div></div>

                <p>If you're itching to create your first worksite, you may be tempted to dive
                    directly into the <span class="emphasis"><em>Sites</em></span> tool. That would probably be a
                    mistake. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Sites</em></span> tool is a powerful way to construct an
                    entire site from the ground up, with fine-grained control over its every page,
                    tool, and configuration detail. But this flexible power comes with a price,
                    making for an intimidating interface and epic-scale workflow. The
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>Sites</em></span> tool is therefore best used as a way to tweak an
                    existing site after the fact, once the standard pieces have been more
                    expediently assembled.</p>
                <p>The best way to start creating sites, therefore, is to use the
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>Worksite Setup</em></span> tool. Click on the
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>New</em></span> link at the top of the tool page, and then, for
                    simplicity's sake, choose the <span class="emphasis"><em>Project</em></span> site type, which will
                    allow you to avoid issues of academic term, etc., that are provoked by a
                    "course" site - issues which are probably unnecessary if you just want to start
                    playing with the tools. Either type of site will serve, however: both types of
                    sites have all the tools available to them.</p>
                <p>Step through the remaining site creation pages, making your preferred
                    selections. Be sure to click the <span class="emphasis"><em>Create Site</em></span> button at the
                    end of the process. After doing so, you should see the site title visible as a
                    new tab along the top of the screen.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="id2334302"></a>6.4.3. Adding Users to Sites</h4></div></div></div>

                <p>Since you set this site up as an admin, the admin is technically the owner of
                    this site, and its only member at first. If you want to add other sample users
                    to this site in different roles, you can do so through the <span class="emphasis"><em>Site
                    Info</em></span> tool of the site itself.</p>
                <p>Click on the tab of your new site (which should now be visible) to enter it,
                    and then click on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Site Info</em></span> link along the lefthand
                    side. <span class="emphasis"><em>Site Info</em></span> has a number of site maintainer functions
                    available as action links across the top, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Add
                    Participants</em></span> is the one that will allow you to connect other users to
                    the site. These users will of course need to have been previously created.</p>
                <p>As long as we're here in <span class="emphasis"><em>Site Info</em></span>, it's worth pointing
                    out that the <span class="emphasis"><em>Edit Tools</em></span> link at the top will allow you to
                    remove and add tools from the site.</p>

<a name="install-software-tools"></a>6.5. Experimenting with Tools</h3></div></div></div>

            <p>You may have noticed an extra tool appear in your site - one which you didn't
                explicitly choose - labeled <span class="emphasis"><em>Help</em></span>. This tool provides online
                documentation of the various bundle tools, and other facets of the system. This
                should be your companion as you learn more about the software's functionality.</p>
            <p>This <span class="emphasis"><em>Help</em></span> tool is also reached in a context-sensitive way by
                clicking on the question mark icons at the upper right of any particular tool frame.
                Clicking on those question marks will open up the precise content of the tool you
                happen to be in at the time.</p>
            <p>At some later point, when you become comfortable with the standard tools, you may
                wish to see other, more experimental tools that are available for Sakai. The Sakai
                distribution includes <span class="emphasis"><em>provisional tools</em></span> that are still
                maturing, but can already serve needs in innovative ways that the standard ones do
                not. These extra tools require additional steps to enable, so that system users will
                not stumble across them inadvertently if that's not desired, but you are encouraged
                to evaluate them for your own deployment. See <a href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/DOC/2.3+Sakai+Tools" target="_top">

            <p>Sakai information has been unfortunately a little fragmented to date. Attempts are
                underway to consolidate and present this information in a more uniform way, but in
                the interim a tourist's guide of the landmarks may be in order.</p>

<a name="id2334450"></a>6.6.1. About the Project</h4></div></div></div>

                <p>The <a href="http://sakaiproject.org" target="_top">sakaiproject.org</a> site
                    offers the best background and orientation to the project and its goals, but
                    chances are you've already seen it. For more particular information on the
                    progress and roadmaps of certain tools or other initiatives, see the Confluence
                    space named <a href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/MGT/Sakai+Project+Management+and+Coordination" target="_top">Management/Project Coordination</a>. That coordinating page will also
                    link you out to Confluence spaces for particular tools, and documentation about

<a name="id2334490"></a>6.6.2. Community Participation</h4></div></div></div>

                <p>The Sakai community hosts its own Sakai installation to serve up collaboration
                    sites for its various sub-groups, and for direct interaction with community
                    members you should join sites there that may be of interest. You can create an
                    account there by visiting <a href="http://collab.sakaiproject.org" target="_top">http://collab.sakaiproject.org</a> and clicking on the <span class="emphasis"><em>New
                        Account</em></span> button. Once your account is created you can log in, and
                    with the <span class="emphasis"><em>Membership</em></span> tool you may join any worksites that
                    may seem appropriate. Joining a site automatically adds you to its email list,
                    and unjoining a worksite similarly removes you (while, it should be noted,
                    sending an "unsubscribe" email will not).</p>

<a name="id2334525"></a>6.6.3. About Technical Matters</h4></div></div></div>

                <p>Reference materials for various technical issues are best found in Sakai's
                    subversion repository (where these installation documents are also stored) or in
                    the project's <a href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence" target="_top">Confluence</a> wiki. The docs in subversion can be found in the reference
                    module, e.g. <a href="https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/reference" target="_top">https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/reference</a>. See in particular the
                        <code class="filename">docs/architecture</code> folder contained there, which
                    contains a wide-ranging collection of technical white papers.</p>
                <p>The Confluence wiki is a more informal source of information, but also
                    valuable and broader in scope. New developers in particular should visit the
                        <a href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/BOOT/Home" target="_top">Programmer's Cafe</a>, while the <a href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/ENC/Home" target="_top">Sakaipedia</a> provides nuggets of insight on a wide array of issues.
                    You're encouraged to create an account there and participate.</p>
                <p>But often the most incisive information comes from direct interaction with
                    your peers. As mentioned above, the <a href="http://collab.sakaiproject.org" target="_top">Collab Server</a> is the place
                    to go for this. For technical questions the best (and most active) such group is
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>DG: Development</em></span>, also commonly referred to by its
                    alias, "sakai-dev."</p>
