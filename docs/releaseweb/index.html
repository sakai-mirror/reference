<h1>Sakai 2.2.0 Release<br/>
 <span style="font:	12px/1.4 Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">(July 19, 2006)</span></h1>
<p>Welcome to the Sakai release page for version 2.2.0!  Sakai 2.2.0 marks the culmination of a significant effort to restructure the framework into more logical
functional/architectural units, paving the way for multiple focused teams to work in parallel on moving the framework and legacy code forward.  This release also incorporates the Open Source Portfolio suite of tools, available in this first merged effort as <a href="provisional.html">provisional tools</a>.  Additional functional improvements include group awareness for each of the Resources, Assignments, and Schedule tools, the inclusion of French and Catalan translations, updated help content, and the addition of four innovative <a href="provisional.html">provisional tools</a>.  See the <a href="release-notes.html">release notes</a> for more details.</p>

<p>On this page you'll find further details concerning what the release includes, along with system requirements, an installation guide, and links to other relevant community spaces for the Sakai project.</p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

			Tomcat 5.5 requires a compatibility package in order to run with Java 1.4, and some Sakai dependencies will require this, even if you are using Java 1.5 to build and run it. This compatibility package is also available from the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi">Tomcat download page</a>.</p>

          <td><p>Sakai uses HSQLDB as its
		"out of the box" database, requiring no special installation
		steps to set up,&nbsp;but this database is not recommended for any
		level of production deployment. &nbsp;Both
		MySQL 4.1.12+  and Oracle 9i+ are currently supported by Sakai 2.2, but setting them up to serve as Sakai's back end will require additional configuration
		(see the <a href="install-overview.html">Installation Guide</a>).</p>
		<p><em class="note">** NOTE: Sakai has not yet been tested adequately against MySQL 5.0, and it is therefore not yet recommended for production, although it has been used successfully in development. <br/>** NOTE: There is an issue with publishing assessments for MySQL versions 4.1.11 or less (see <a href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-4416">SAK-4416</a>), and so MySQL 4.1.12 or greater is recommended.</em></p>
		<p>It's important to note that Oracle requires the 10g driver even if Oracle 9i is used for the database.  The recommended driver for MySQL is 3.1.12, since there is a greater weight of production success behind it; although early testing has revealed no significant problems with the 3.1.13 driver, it should be used advisedly.</p>

<p></p>
<strong>Hardware note:</strong>
Hardware recommendations depend on the scale of the installation.
&nbsp;Sakai should run on a middle-class laptop for purposes of development or tool demonstration, but
at least 1GB of memory is recommended for Sakai to run smoothly for
multiple users concurrently accessing the system, while a production environment for a large institution will likely
involve clustered application servers.

<h3>Getting the Latest Source Code</h3>
<p>Sakai is using Subversion for its source control, and has maintenance branches - which include the latest bug fixes - for its most current releases . You can check out the maintenance branch for Sakai 2.2 with a subversion client:<p>

<p><b>svn export https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/sakai/branches/sakai_2-2-x/ </b></p>
<p>
The Sakai development trunk can be checked out from here:
</p>
<p><b>svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/sakai/trunk</b></p>

<p>A minimal source tree designed for developers is also made available, called "Sakai Mini," which is meant to build and start up relatively quickly. It includes the Sakai Framework Technologies, the developer's Sakai
Mercury portal, and a few of the basic applications.  You can check it out of subversion, then just add your application
code and any further dependencies that your application needs.  You can grab it here: </p>
<p><b>svn export https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/sakai/branches/sakai_mini/</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="issues"></a>
<h3>
Issue Tracking
</h3>
 Bug reports and feature requests may be created and monitored through our Jira system:
<a href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa">
Sakai Jira </a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="community"></a>
<h3>Community</h3>

 <p>The Sakai community interacts online mainly in two forums.  The first is through the email archives attached to the sites on <a href="http://collab.sakaiproject.org">Sakai Collab</a>.  "Collab" is a Sakai-based service run by the Sakai Foundation to support
the collaboration of its community.  For technical questions, <b>sakai-dev</b> is the most active such site, but many others are available, ranging from pedagogy to UI design. We encourage you to create an account, join any groups on the collab server for which you may have an interest, and participate.</p>
<p>To join, for example, the developer's site, simply create an account from the gateway page, log in, and then use the "Membership" tool to join the site labeled <b>DG: Development</b>. By joining this site you are automatically added to the
<a href="mailto:sakai-dev@collab.sakaiproject.org">sakai-dev@collab.sakaiproject.org</a> mailing list.   To "unsubscribe" from any of the lists, simply use the same Membership tool to unjoin the sites.  <em class="note"> ** NOTE: This is not technically a listserv, so that sending an "unsubscribe" email will accomplish nothing.</em></p>

 <p>The second forum is <a href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence">Confluence</a>, the wiki web used by the project.  Confluence is used for a wide variety of purposes: the collaborative forging of documentation or design ideas, project management reporting, and the sharing of notes on a wide array of topics.  You can browse its pages there anonymously, but if you want to comment or otherwise participate you're encouraged to create an account there as well.</p>
