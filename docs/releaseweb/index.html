<p>The Sakai 2.3 series as a whole presents more in the way of feature enhancements and less in the way of API changes than 2.2. Three new provisional tools have been added, while two very successful provisional tools have been promoted to the enterprise bundle. Several existing tools have seen significant enhancements, along with general improvements for the portal and configuration options in sakai.properties.  See the <a href="release-notes.html">release notes</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>
Sakai is Java-based, and will therefore run on a wide variety of platforms. &nbsp;The platforms against which Sakai 2.3.1 has been specifically QA'ed, however, are:<br />

Sakai does include some applets, so see the <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102171-1">security alert from Sun</a> to get details on the recommended minor versions.</em></p>

			  <p>
			Tomcat 5.5 requires a compatibility package in order to run with Java 1.4 code, and some Sakai dependencies will also require this package, even though Java 1.5 is used to build and run Sakai. This compatibility package is also available from the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi">Tomcat download page</a>.</p>

		MySQL 4.1.12+  and Oracle 9i+ are currently supported by Sakai 2.3, but setting them up to serve as Sakai's back end will require additional configuration
		(see the <a href="install-overview.html">Installation Guide</a>).</p>

		<p>Sakai requires transaction support, and so the InnoDB storage engine will be needed for MySQL deployments.</p>

		<p>It's important to note that Oracle requires the 10g driver even if Oracle 9i is used for the database.  The recommended driver for MySQL is 3.1.14.</p>

<h3>Getting the Latest Source Code</h3>
<p>Sakai is using Subversion for its source control, and has maintenance branches - which include the latest bug fixes - for its most current releases. You can check out the maintenance branch for Sakai 2.3 with a subversion client:<p>

<p><b>svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/sakai/branches/sakai_2-3-x/ </b></p>
<p>
If you don't wish to track and merge changes with subversion you can use 'svn export' instead.  The Sakai development trunk can be checked out from here:
</p>
<p><b>svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/sakai/trunk</b></p>

<p>A minimal source tree designed for developers is also made available, called "Sakai Mini," which is meant to build and start up relatively quickly. It includes the Sakai Framework Technologies, the developer's Sakai
Mercury portal, and a few of the basic applications.  You can check it out of subversion, then just add your application
code and any further dependencies that your application needs.  You can grab it here, e.g.: </p>
<p><b>svn export https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/mini/tags/sakai_2-3-1/</b></p>
<p>(Since the mini is mainly just a convenient support for other development, it's likely that 'svn export' will be the preferred, cleaner way to get this codebase)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="issues"></a>
<h3>
Issue Tracking
</h3>
 Bug reports and feature requests may be created and monitored through our Jira system:
<a href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa">
Sakai Jira </a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="community"></a>
<h3>Community</h3>

 <p>The Sakai community interacts online mainly in two forums.  The first is through the email archives attached to the sites on <a href="http://collab.sakaiproject.org">Sakai Collab</a>.  "Collab" is a Sakai-based service run by the Sakai Foundation to support
the collaboration of its community.  For technical questions, <b>sakai-dev</b> is the most active such site, but many others are available, ranging from pedagogy to UI design. We encourage you to create an account, join any groups on the collab server for which you may have an interest, and participate.</p>
<p>To join, for example, the developer's site, simply create an account from the gateway page, log in, and then use the "Membership" tool to join the site labeled <b>DG: Development</b>. By joining this site you are automatically added to the
<a href="mailto:sakai-dev@collab.sakaiproject.org">sakai-dev@collab.sakaiproject.org</a> mailing list.   To "unsubscribe" from any of the lists, simply use the same Membership tool to unjoin the sites.  <em class="note"> ** NOTE: This is not technically a listserv, so that sending an "unsubscribe" email will accomplish nothing.</em></p>

 <p>The second forum is <a href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence">Confluence</a>, the wiki web used by the project.  Confluence is used for a wide variety of purposes: the collaborative forging of documentation or design ideas, project management reporting, and the sharing of notes on a wide array of topics.  You can browse its pages there anonymously, but if you want to comment or otherwise participate you're encouraged to create an account there as well.</p>
