        <p>Below are a number of common issues encountered while building and starting up Sakai,
            but you may also benefit from the expert opinions that reside on the sakai-dev list. To
            join, visit collab.sakaiproject.org, create a new account, log in to your <span class="emphasis"><em>My
                Workspace</em></span>, and then use the <span class="emphasis"><em>Membership</em></span> tool to join
            the group named <span class="emphasis"><em>DG: Development</em></span>. Then you can begin to send emails
            to (and receive them from) sakai-dev@collab.sakaiproject.org. To later unsubscribe, you
            can simply use the same <span class="emphasis"><em>Membership</em></span> tool to unjoin the site.</p>

<a name="id2334657"></a>7.1.1. JAR download failures</h4></div></div></div>

                <p>A first build of Maven on a fresh installation may warn of numerous jar
                    download failures if you include the <span class="emphasis"><em>clean</em></span> phase. This is a
                    nuisance, but not otherwise a problem. Even when doing a clean maven tries to
                    download all dependencies, including those Sakai jars that may not be built
                    until the later <span class="emphasis"><em>build</em></span> phase. Once they are built and placed
                    into the repository, maven is perfectly happy for the next "clean build" cycle.
                    The upshot is that you may see these errors for your first build, but you
                    shouldn't see them for subsequent builds. It also means that you're better off
                    not including the <span class="emphasis"><em>clean</em></span> phase during your first build of a
                    new version of the code.</p>
                <p>If this does not account for the download failures you're seeing, then you may
                    want to double-check your <span><strong class="command">maven.remote.repo</strong></span> setting. See the
                        <a href="install-env.html#install-env-mconfig" title="2.6. Configure Maven">Maven Configuration</a> section, and
                    follow it precisely.</p>

<a name="id2334716"></a>7.1.2. Out of Memory errors</h4></div></div></div>

                <p>You may find that your machine runs out of memory while it is building Sakai.
                    As it turns out, maven does not read <span><strong class="command">JAVA_OPTS</strong></span> when it starts
                    up, and so if your build output complains of "Out of Memory" errors you'll need
                    to set an additional environment variable, namely,
                    <span><strong class="command">MAVEN_OPTS</strong></span>. The value in the sample Unix command below should
                    be more than enough:</p>
                <pre class="screen">
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx384m -XX:PermSize=48m"</pre>

<a name="id2334749"></a>7.1.3. Uninformative failure messages</h4></div></div></div>

                <p>If you need more detailed output to track down a build error, maven can be run
                    in debug mode by adding the -x argument, e.g. <span><strong class="command">maven
                -x</strong></span>.</p>

<a name="id2334769"></a>7.1.4. Building only a single module</h4></div></div></div>

                <p>If you'd like to have the Sakai build targets and goals available for building
                    only a single module (i.e. instead of rebuilding the entire source tree again to
                    accomplish this), then you'll want to have the maven plugin for Sakai installed.
                    Installing the plugin makes it available whenever you use maven, not just for
                    those projects that declare a dependency on the plugin. You will need to do this
                    once each time you upgrade a minor point version of sakai.</p>
                <pre class="screen">
maven plugin:download -DgroupId=sakaiproject -DartifactId=sakai -Dversion=2.2</pre>
                <p>Note that the version you should use in the above command is the one found as
                    the value of the <span><strong class="command">sakai.plugin.version</strong></span> property in the
                        <code class="filename">sakai/master/project.properties</code> file. It is not
                    necessarily (and in fact often isn't) the same as the version of Sakai you're
                    using.</p>

                <p>Once you have Sakai installed, configured and started, you can monitor Sakai
                    by watching the logs. The log level for the standard Sakai source code and the
                    demo is set to show <span class="emphasis"><em>info</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>warnings</em></span>
                    only. Watch for the WARN: messages. There are going to be some "normal" ones at
                    startup, and some will likely slip by at runtime, but any warning is potentially
                    something you might want to check out.</p>
                <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Changing the Log Configuration</h3>

                    <p>To change the logging for Sakai, you need to change Sakai source code and
                        re-deploy sakai. The file you need to change is
                            <code class="filename">sakai-src/kernel/log-configure/src/conf/log4j.properties</code>,
                        and the relevant property is:</p>
                    <pre class="screen">
log4j.logger.org.sakaiproject=INFO</pre>
                    <p>To turn on debug logging for all of Sakai, change that value from INFO to
                        DEBUG. In order to turn on debug logging for just a single component of
                        Sakai, add a line such as in the following example, which will leave most of
                        Sakai at INFO, but generate DEBUG level messages for the SQL service:</p>
                    <pre class="screen">
log4j.logger.org.sakaiproject=INFO
log4j.logger.org.sakaiproject.component.framework.sql.BasicSqlService=DEBUG</pre>
                    <p>The logging controls are part of the new LogConfigurationManager,
                        implemented as a component, the
                        <code class="filename">Log4jConfigurationManager</code>, in the util module. It can
                        be disabled, if we really don't want it to do anything, with an entry in
                            <code class="filename">sakai.properties</code>:</p>

                    <pre class="screen">
enabled@org.sakaiproject.log.api.LogConfigurationManager = false</pre>

                    <p>Logging levels are first established in the log4j configuration file we
                        deploy from Sakai. The source for this file is in:
                            <code class="filename">sakai/util/util-impl/log/src/conf/log4j.properties</code>.
                        This is made into a jar and deployed to common (this is a requirement of
                        log4j configuration in Tomcat). We can set logging levels in this file. For
                        example:</p>

                    <pre class="screen">
# Application logging options
log4j.logger.org.sakaiproject=INFO

# Ignore erroneous MyFaces variable resolver warnings
log4j.logger.org.apache.myfaces.el.VariableResolverImpl=ERROR</pre>

                    <p>This sets any logger with "org.sakaiproject.*" to INFO level, and the
                        "org.apache.myfaces.el.VariableResolverImpl" to ERROR level. The problem
                        with this approach, however, is that it requires a change to the source, and
                        a redeploy. Hardly convenient.</p>
                    <p>Happily, logging levels can now also be specified in
                            <code class="filename">sakai.properties</code>. This augments and overrides the
                        levels set in the default config file. Example:</p>

                    <pre class="screen">
log.config.count=3
log.config.1 = ALL.org.sakaiproject.log.impl
log.config.2 = OFF.org.sakaiproject
log.config.3 = DEBUG.org.sakaiproject.db.impl</pre>

                    <p>This uses the established (but awkward) method of having a name.count
                        followed by name.1, name,2, etc. to form an array of strings for the value
                        "name". In this case, the name is "log.config". The values are of the form
                            <span><strong class="command">LEVEL.logger</strong></span>, and the possible levels are: OFF TRACE
                        DEBUG INFO WARN ERROR FATAL ALL.</p>
                    <p>As you can see, Sakai uses log4j for logging. See the official log4j
                        documentation for more information about how to configure it if you have
                        questions.</p>
                </div>
                <p>For Mac and *nix systems, the most important log is found in
                        <code class="filename">logs/catalina.out</code> of Tomcat. It can be instructive to
                    watch this log as Tomcat is starting up, by using a startup command like the
                    following:</p>
                <pre class="screen">
bin/startup.sh; tail -f logs/catalina.out</pre>
                <p>Tomcat on Windows tends to be a little more puzzling about its logs, and it
                    includes more of them, but its default behavior is to open
                        <code class="filename">catalina.out</code> in a new window as soon as you start
                    Tomcat. If you need more information about the logs in Windows, we'll refer you
                    to the official Tomcat documentation.</p>
                <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Other Logs</h3>

                    <p>The SMTP server logs from Sakai will be written to the
                            <code class="filename">$CATALINA_HOME/sakai/logs</code> directory.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="sect3" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="id2335027"></a>7.2.2. "Unsupported major.minor version 49.0"</h4></div></div></div>

                <p>If this message appears in catalina.out during startup, it means that you've
                    built Sakai for Java 1.5, but your JRE is 1.4. Go back to the <a href="install-env.html#install-env-jenv" title="2.2. Verify Java Environment Variables">Set up Build Environment</a> section and
                    double-check your Java version and environment variables.</p>

                <p>If this message appears in catalina.out during startup, it means that some
                    other application is already running on the port you've assigned for this Tomcat
                    instance. It's most likely another Tomcat. It may be that you didn't stop Tomcat
                    from a previous run, or you may already have Tomcat running on that machine.</p>
                <p>If you need to run more than one Tomcat on the same machine, see Tomcat
                    documentation for instructions on how to configure to run Tomcat on a different
                    port.</p>
