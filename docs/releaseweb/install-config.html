            <p>Sakai runs with a default set of configuration properties for its various
                components. To override them you'll want to specify them in a
                    <code class="filename">sakai.properties</code> file which should be located in
                    <code class="filename">$CATALINA_HOME/sakai</code> by default. This directory is not
                created by maven, so you'll have to do so manually.</p>
            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Choosing a different location for sakai.properties</h3>

                <p>You may find it preferable to store Sakai's configuration files outside of the
                    Tomcat file hierarchy. In a development environment, for example, you may find
                    yourself frequently blowing Tomcat away, and you'll likely want to avoid
                    recreating the sakai folder and its contained file(s) each time.</p>
                <p>To accomplish this, you need only modify the java startup command (or the
                        <span><strong class="command">JAVA_OPTS</strong></span> environment variable) to set the system
                    property <span><strong class="command">sakai.home</strong></span>:</p>
                <pre class="screen">-Dsakai.home=/path/to/desired/sakai/home/</pre>
                <p>You'll need to make sure that this location is readable and writable to
                    Tomcat.</p>

<a name="install-config-skprop"></a>4.2. The sakai.properties file</h3></div></div></div>

            <p>The main configuration file for Sakai is called
                <code class="filename">sakai.properties</code>, and you can either create it from scratch or
                copy in a known working copy. A sample <code class="filename">sakai.properties</code> file
                which self-documents many of the standard properties in its comments can be found in
                the source under <span><strong class="command">sakai-src/reference/docs/sakai.properties</strong></span>, while
                the properties file that the OOTB software uses as its default may be found in
                    <code class="filename">sakai-src/kernel/component/src/config/org/sakaiproject/config/sakai.properties.</code></p>
            <p>New value settings can be freely added to the
                <code class="filename">sakai.properties</code> file. Since any component property can in
                principle be overridden here, any sample <code class="filename">sakai.properties</code> will
                show only a small fraction of all the possible settings.</p>

                <p>Settings in <code class="filename">sakai.properties</code> govern everything from
                    setting your institution name to configuring your database. The essential
                    settings for installation are covered here, but to find the most detailed
                    documentation on the full variety of possible

<a name="install-config-email"></a>4.3. Email configuration</h3></div></div></div>

            <p>Sakai needs to be set up for two email functions: receiving email sent to Sakai
                sites, and sending out email notifications. For sending mail Sakai needs the address
                (name or IP) of an SMTP server that will accept mail from Sakai, and this needs to
                be set in your <code class="filename">sakai.properties</code> file:</p>
            <pre class="screen">smtp@org.sakaiproject.email.api.EmailService=some.smtp.org</pre>
            <p>To enable Sakai to receive mail you'll need to set the following:</p>
            <pre class="screen">
# dns addresses used for incoming email
smtp.dns.1 = 255.255.255.1
smtp.dns.2 = 255.255.255.2

# SMTP port on which our SMTP server runs. Default is 25.
#Recommend running on 8025, and using a standard mailer on 25 to forward mail to Sakai.
smtp.port = 25

# flag to enable or disable our SMTP server for incoming email (true | false)
smtp.enabled = true</pre>
            <p>To disable the SMTP server for incoming email, use this line in
                    <code class="filename">sakai.properties</code>:</p>
            <pre class="screen">smtp.enabled=false</pre>
            <p>Sakai's SMTP server is <span class="emphasis"><em>James</em></span>, and to run with the above
                configuration which runs James on the standard SMTP port 25 you must be running with
                admin privileges. Most admins won't want to let Tomcat run with those permissions,
                and would rather run a standard mailer like postfix on port 25 and configure it to
                forward requests to Sakai. You might also already have a mailer service running on
                port 25 (Linux usually has it running by default), and so you'd want to change the
                James port simply to avoid a conflict. For example:</p>
            <pre class="screen">smtp.port = 8025</pre>

            <p>The default Java virtual machine is not adequate to run an application of Sakai's
                size, and several JVM parameters must be increased to a certain threshold for Sakai
                to run, while some may be further adjusted for optimal performance on your machines.</p>
            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Disclaimer</h3>

                <p>JVM tuning is, as a general rule, something of a black art, and we recommend
                    that you take the time to experiment with different memory and garbage
                    collection settings and see what works best in your environment. We can make
                    some minimal recommendations that should serve as a foundation for further
                    experimentation and testing, but the following details are however offered only
                    as samples or suggestions, and we recommend that you consult a systems
                    administrator or local Java guru before making any such changes to a production
                    system. See the <a href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/BOOT/Sakai+2.2+developer+JVM+tuning" target="_top">Programmer's Cafe</a> on our Confluence wiki for more discussion of the
                    details.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The standard way to control the JVM options when Tomcat starts up is to have an
                environment variable <span><strong class="command">JAVA_OPTS</strong></span> defined with JVM startup options.
                Since any given Sakai instance may be deployed for a variety of purposes - ranging
                from developers doing private testing to large-scale deployments - it's hard to
                recommend a single set of such options as the preferred ones for every case. We can,
                however, start with a bare minimum which will at least avoid "Out of Memory" errors,
                and be suitable for developer installs of the software:</p>
            <pre class="screen">
JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xms512m -Xmx768m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=196m -XX:NewSize=192m -XX:MaxNewSize=384m"</pre>
            <p>This is an adequate - if minimal - starting point: it selects server mode, sets an
                adequate heap size, and sizes the permanent generation to accommodate more
                longer-persisting objects. These settings will allow things to be functional for
                testing and development, but will hardly be adequate for serving large numbers of
                concurrent users. A more suitable production environment on a 32-bit machine with
                multiple processors might use a set of options like:</p>
            <pre class="screen">
JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xms1500m -Xmx1500m -XX:NewSize=400m -XX:MaxNewSize=400m -XX:PermSize=128m
-XX:MaxPermSize=196m -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC"</pre>
            <p>This is better: a larger heap size is set for smoother performance (we have found
                the best results when the min and max memory settings - Xms and Xmx, respectively -
                are set to be the same values), and garbage collection messages are turned on.
                Another important consideration is the ratio of <span class="emphasis"><em>NewSize</em></span> to the
                size of the heap. We want as large a <span class="emphasis"><em>NewSize</em></span> as we can fit in
                the total heap, while keeping the total heap significantly bigger than
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>NewSize</em></span> in order for Java to properly garbage collect. The
                last two arguments above can produce a performance improvement if you have two or
                more processors on your machine, however your performance will be better if you
                don't include them for single-processor machines.</p>
            <p>As you can see, there's a lot to think about here, and in practice each
                implementing institution uses their own particular <span><strong class="command">JAVA_OPTS</strong></span> that
                they've settled on for their deployment and hardware, and they often use more option
                arguments than we've shown here. This discussion is meant only as a head start, and
                there is no replacement for doing your own testing.</p>
            <p>Once you set <span><strong class="command">JAVA_OPTS</strong></span> Tomcat will see this environment
                variable upon startup and use it. Instead of putting this in an environment variable
                you might create your own startup script to do so.</p>

<h3 class="title">JVM Tuning in Windows XP</h3>

                <p>Windows users that have installed Tomcat as a service may set Java options in
                    a <span class="emphasis"><em>Tomcat Properties</em></span> dialog. But you may find that the
                    permanent generation settings mentioned above will not work appropriately if set
                    in the "Java Options:" field of the dialog window. That's because these settings
                    have their own fields in the properties GUI, under the headings
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>Initial Memory Pool</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Maximum Memory
                    Pool</em></span>, respectively. Windows will ignore attempts to alter these
                    values through the Java Options field.</p>

            <p>At this stage your installation of Sakai has not yet been configured to use your
                preferred database (it will use its own HSQLDB by default), but you should now be
                able to bring it up as a working web application by simply starting Tomcat, and it
                can be helpful at this point to know if any problems exist before you try to connect
                it to another database. Tomcat will take a minute or so to start up, depending on
                the speed of your machine, and it's a good idea to watch the Tomcat log as it comes
                up to catch any errors (see <a href="install-tshoot.html" title="7. Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>).</p>
            <p>From <span><strong class="command">$CATALINA_HOME</strong></span> you can start up Tomcat with the command:</p>

            <p>Once Tomcat has loaded the Sakai application (again, this can take a minute or so)
                point your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080/portal" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/portal</a>. If the gateway page does not come up,
                check the Tomcat logs (see the <a href="install-tshoot.html" title="7. Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>
                section) for any errors and stack traces. If the gateway page does come up, log in
                with the default admin account (the username and password are both 'admin'). If you
                can log in without errors you should be able to stop Tomcat and proceed with
